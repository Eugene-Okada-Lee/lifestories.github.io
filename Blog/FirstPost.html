                    <p>Another year… another dollar? another blessing? another opportunity to grow? Or maybe just all of the above? Simply put, 2022 has been a year full of good change, determination, and discovery. </p>

                    <p>To start off the year I came back home to the grace of my patient parents, leaving behind all the memories and worn out furniture from university. I unpacked my bags in my old childhood room, setting it up like I never left. Once settled, I began navigating through post grad life and figuring out the answer to the one of the most daunting questions you can ask a 20 something year old with a degree and no plan: “What’s next?”.</p>

                   <p>In 2022, I experienced immense growing pains and was hit with “adulthood” very hard. I had to make decisions pertaining to my career, relationships, and figuring out how to make the “right” decision while trying to balance my goals and ambitions, while trying to stay happy. I had to think about the future… which scared me. At the time of making all these decisions, its felt like it was do or die, like my life was gonna fail if I made the wrong decision. I honestly have never felt so lost and scared about what I had to do to not disappoint my family, friends, and myself. Throughout all of these growing pains, here are the three key things I want to take with me into the new year: </p>



                    <p><b>1. Starting over does not make you a failure.</b> </p>

                    <blockquote>This year marked the first time I lived with my parents after leaving them to start college when I was 18. </blockquote>

                    <p><b>2. If it costs you your peace and well being, it’s not worth it.</b> </p>

                    <blockquote>I spent a lot of time stressing over what path I wanted to take</blockquote>

                    <p><b>3. When you overthink, most of the time it comes from fears not facts.</b> </p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p><b>4. Time at home with family and/or loved ones is always the quickest way to rejuvenate the soul.
                    </b> </p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <p><b>5. Celebrate all forms of accomplishments and celebrate them often. It is important to be proud of the steps you have taken to be the person you are now.</b> </p>

                    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

                    <h3 class="subheading"><center>The word of the year for me has been connection.</center></h3>

                    <p> If not for my strong connection to my family, I would not have been able to comfortably move home and take the necessary time to figure out my direction for myself. If not for my  connections to all my friends/old coworkers, I would not have been able to have an opportunity to work at a temporary job to develop necessary professional skills which landed me my current job. If not for my connection to all of you, in whatever shape or form, I would not be the person I am today. Connection is important. You are all important me and have affected me in some way throughout my life. I won’t lie to you… this year wasn’t very eventful for me and I spent a lot of time figuring out the answer to “What’s next?”. Though I don’t have a clear answer to the question, I can tell you that I’m happy. I’m learning a lot about how to be the best version of myself. I’m growing up. There weren’t any glorious trips or accomplishments to brag about this year, however I am proud of the person I am becoming and I am excited for what I will be able to experience and take on in 2023 thanks to all the personal growth I have experienced from 2022. Thank you for always supporting me. Happy new year, cheers to 2023. </p>
